# PythonLabCreateMoreFunctions

Introduction:

Built-in functions are functions that exist within Python and can be called directly. They help
analysts efficiently complete tasks. Python also supports user-defined functions. These are functions
that analysts write for their specific needs.
For example, patterns in login attempts could reveal suspicious activity. Python functions can
help analysts work efficiently with lists of login attempts. Both built-in functions and user-defined
functions in Python can help security analysts analyze login attempts.
In this lab, you’ll use built-in functions to work with a list of failed login attempts per month to
prepare it for further analysis, and you’ll define a function that compares the user’s login attempts
for the current day to their average number of login attempts.

Scenario:

In your work as a security analyst, you’re responsible for working with a list that contains the
number of failed attempts that occurred each month. You’ll identify any patterns that might
indicate malicious activity. You’re also responsible for defining a function that compares the logins
for the current day to an average and improving it by adding a return statement.
